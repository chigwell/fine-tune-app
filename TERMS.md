**Last updated: 11 December 2025**

Thank you for using **Fine-tune.app** (the **“Service”**). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms of Service (the **“Terms”**). If you do not accept all of the Terms, do not use the Service.

## 1. Who we are

“**We**”, “**us**”, and “**our**” mean the operators of Fine-tune.app. “**You**” means the person or organisation using the Service.

-----

## 2. Description of the Service

- Fine-tune.app provides a web dashboard and API for fine-tuning small models (e.g., ~270M parameter classes) and exporting them as **GGUF** files for local use.
- Features, limits, models, and pricing may change at any time without notice.
- The Service is intended for experimentation, development, and research. It is **not** for life-critical, safety-critical, or emergency use.

-----

## 3. Accounts, access tokens, and security

- You are responsible for keeping your account and any access tokens **secret** and **secure**.
- We may rate-limit, suspend, or revoke access to protect the Service from abuse.
- You are responsible for all activity under your account or tokens.

-----

## 4. Your data and uploads

- You retain rights to the datasets and prompts you submit and the models you fine-tune, subject to any upstream licences on base models.
- You grant us a non-exclusive licence to process your data solely to operate, secure, troubleshoot, and improve the Service.
- You must ensure you have the right to upload any data you submit and that it does not infringe third-party rights.

-----

## 5. Outputs, accuracy, and your responsibility

- Model outputs (including fine-tuned models) can be **inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, or fabricated**.
- Outputs may be outdated or otherwise unreliable. **Do not** treat outputs as legal, medical, financial, or other professional advice.
- You must independently verify any critical output before relying on it. **You use the Service at your own risk.**

-----

## 6. Acceptable use

You agree **not** to:

- Violate any applicable laws or third-party rights.
- Upload, generate, or distribute content that is unlawful, harmful, or abusive.
- Attempt to bypass security, rate limits, usage caps, or payment requirements.
- Misrepresent AI-generated output as human-generated where disclosure is legally required.
- Scrape or bulk-harvest in ways that degrade or disrupt the Service.

We may suspend or terminate access for suspected violations.

-----

## 7. GGUF downloads and third-party use

- Downloaded GGUF files are provided “as is.” You are responsible for how you use or distribute them.
- Third-party frameworks, hardware, or hosting you use with GGUF files may have their own terms; we are not responsible for those services.

-----

## 8. Availability and changes

- The Service is provided on a **best-efforts** basis. We do **not** guarantee **uptime**, **latency**, **throughput**, or availability of any particular **model** or **feature**.
- We may modify, replace, or withdraw models and features at any time.
- Access may be limited or withdrawn without notice if required for security, operational, legal, or compliance reasons.

-----

## 9. Fees and billing

- Pricing (if any), usage limits, and billing terms are shown in the dashboard or at checkout and may change on renewal or with notice as required by law.
- Taxes may apply. Refunds (if any) follow the terms shown at purchase and applicable consumer protections.

-----

## 10. Data protection and privacy

- We process only the data needed to operate and protect the Service (e.g., authentication, usage, and security logs).
- We do **not** sell personal data. Retention and your privacy rights are described in our privacy notice (if provided separately).

-----

## 11. No warranties

The Service and any outputs are provided **“as is”** and **“as available”**, **without warranties of any kind**, whether express or implied, including **merchantability**, **fitness for a particular purpose**, **non-infringement**, and **accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness** of outputs.

-----

## 12. Limitation of liability

To the **maximum extent permitted by law**, we and our officers, employees, agents, and contributors will **not** be liable for any **indirect**, **incidental**, **special**, **consequential**, or **punitive** losses or damages, or for **loss of profits**, **revenue**, **data**, or **business interruption**, arising out of or related to your use of (or inability to use) the Service, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability for **death or personal injury caused by negligence**, **fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation**, or any other liability that **cannot lawfully be limited or excluded**.

-----

## 13. Indemnity

You agree to **defend, indemnify, and hold harmless** us and our contributors from any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from: (a) your use of the Service; (b) your breach of these Terms; or (c) your violation of third-party rights or applicable law.

## 14. Term, suspension, and termination

- These Terms apply while you use the Service.
- We may suspend, restrict, or terminate access at any time at our sole discretion, including for security risks, suspected fraud or abuse, or operational, legal, or compliance reasons.

-----

## 15. Export controls and sanctions

You must comply with applicable **export control** and **sanctions** laws and may not use the Service if you are barred under those laws.
